Quizlet Auto Complete
=====================

Chrome extension that allows you to use Quizlet's auto-define feature to autocomplete definitions.

I created this extension to fulfill a personal use case/concern. I found clicking the auto-define
button to be too time consuming. I wanted to be able to start typing in a definition and see if it
already exists in Quizlet's database while having it fill in the rest.

It works in the background, and if you ever want to turn it off, just disable the extension.
